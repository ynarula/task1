<th style="font-family: 'Merienda';">Merging pop-punk energy and ebullient boy band charisma, Australia's 5 Seconds<br>
 of Summer burst onto the international music scene in the early 2010s, attracting fans <br>
 with anthemic, hook-oriented songs that helped land their self-titled 2014 debut at number<br> 
 one on the pop charts. While follow-up album Sounds Good Feels Good retained their<br>
  guitar-based sound -- scoring 5 Seconds of Summer their second Australian and U.S. <br>
  chart-topper -- they underwent a major pop reinvention in 2018 with their third <br>
  number one, YOUNGBLOOD, which debuted a refined electronic dance-pop vibe.</th>
